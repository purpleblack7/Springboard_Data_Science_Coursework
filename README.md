# Springboard_Data_Science_Coursework

This was something that I did as part of a coursework from Springboard to become a Data Scientist. To be honest I never managed to get the certification although I did complete the coursework
I think by that time I realized that Data Science wasn't for me

However I did learn my base of statistics and I attribute a lot of my Python coding skills to this program


This program was taken during the pandemic (COVID-19) so yeah, it was a fuzzy time in general


I decided to keep this on as this repository reminds me of 2020 and all the good/bad memories I made during that time in quarantine


P.S- I barely knew git at that time. Upon writing this README I guess I must have uploaded them through drag and drop. Silly me!
